    ### Transition Matrix Estimation Methodology

    Given a set of possible states $S = \{ \text{Current}, \text{30 Days Delinquent}, \text{60 Days Delinquent}, \text{90+ Days Delinquent}, \text{Paid Off} \}$,
    the goal is to estimate a transition probability matrix $P$, where each entry $P_{ij}$ represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$.

    #### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
    
    Using observed data, the transition probabilities can be estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Suppose $N_{ij}$ denotes the number of observed transitions from state $i$ to state $j$ across all loan sequences. The MLE for the transition probability $P_{ij}$ is given by:
    
    $\hat{P}_{ij} = \frac{N_{ij}}{\sum_{k} N_{ik}}$

    where $\sum_{k} N_{ik}$ is the total number of transitions observed from state $i$ to any other state. This ensures that each row in the transition matrix sums to 1.

    #### Step-by-Step Process

    1. **Categorize Loan States**: Each loan's delinquency status is categorized into discrete states such as *Current*, *30 Days Delinquent*, etc.
    2. **Calculate Transitions**: For each loan, calculate transitions between these states by observing consecutive periods.
    3. **Estimate Transition Matrix**: Using MLE, we compute the probability of moving from one state to another as shown above.

    The lookback period determines the number of consecutive months used to estimate transition probabilities. 
    Here’s why different windows might be preferred:
    
    - **3-6 Months**: Often chosen for shorter-term risk assessment, capturing recent borrower behavior and adapting to economic shifts.
    - **12 Months**: Common in annual risk assessments, this window smooths seasonal patterns and is often used in regulatory models.
    - **18+ Months**: Longer periods may provide stable trends in risk but can dilute recent changes, so they’re usually used in strategic, longer-term models.

        ### Steady-State Probabilities and Long-Run Equilibrium
    
        In a Markov chain, **steady-state probabilities** represent the long-run probability of being in each state, regardless of the initial state. This concept is also known as the **long-run equilibrium**. When a Markov chain reaches this equilibrium, the probability distribution of states becomes constant, meaning that further transitions no longer change the distribution.
    
        #### Mathematical Definition
        Suppose we have a transition matrix $P$ for a Markov chain. The steady-state vector $\pi$ is a probability vector that satisfies:
        
        $\pi = \pi P$
        
        Alternatively, in the limit form, if we start with an initial state distribution $\pi_0$ and let the Markov chain evolve, then:
        
        $\pi = \lim_{n \to \infty} \pi_0 P^n$
        
        where $\pi$ is the **steady-state distribution** and $P^n$ represents the transition matrix raised to the power $n$. In practice, this means that as $n$ becomes large, the rows of $P^n$ converge to the steady-state probabilities, and the probabilities stabilize.
    
        #### Conditions for Reaching Steady State
        For a Markov chain to reach steady-state probabilities, certain conditions must be met:
        
        1. **Irreducibility**: Every state must be reachable from every other state, either directly or through intermediate states.
        2. **Aperiodicity**: The chain should not have fixed cycles; in other words, there should be no specific number of steps required to return to a state.
        3. **Positive Recurrence**: The Markov chain should have a probability of returning to each state within a finite amount of time.
        
        If these conditions are satisfied, the Markov chain is called **ergodic**. An ergodic Markov chain has a unique steady-state distribution, which is reached regardless of the starting state.
    
        #### Importance of Steady-State Probabilities
        Steady-state probabilities are highly useful for understanding the **long-term behavior** of a system. For example:
        
        - **Long-Term Predictions**: They allow us to predict the long-run proportion of time the system will spend in each state.
        - **Arbitrarily Long Time Steps**: Once the chain reaches steady state, we no longer need to calculate transitions step-by-step. Instead, we can use the steady-state probabilities as an approximation for any arbitrarily long number of steps.
        - **Risk Assessment and Planning**: In contexts such as credit modeling or asset risk, the steady-state probabilities help in assessing long-term exposure to states like delinquency or default, guiding decision-making and planning.
    
        By raising the transition matrix to a large power or solving for $\pi$, we can estimate the steady-state probabilities and gain insights into the expected long-term behavior of the system.
